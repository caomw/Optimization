\section{Introduction}

\IEEEPARstart{F}{unction} optimization is a field of mathematics that deals with the search of the input element of a function that yields the output that best conforms with some predefined criteria. This seach has many applications throughout different scientific fields, from economics to control engineering. Some applications of function minimization are the training of neural networks, simultaneos localization and mapping (SLAM), and real time optimization (RTO) control.

Several different methods of function optimization are presented in the following sections. These methods are described and compared, focusing on pratical aspects such as complexity, convergence issues and issues with logal minima.

\section{Code Glossary}

The code that was used to exemplify and evaluate the optimization methods presented later in this paper were programmed using MATLAB. The files can be divided in two groups, functions and scripts. Next is a glossary of the files contained in this work
